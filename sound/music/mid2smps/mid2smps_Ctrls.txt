Controllers
-----------
Hex/Dec	General MIDI		mid2smps
------------------------------------------------
00/0	Bank Select MSB		[FM] Select FM instrument bank
		00-4F - use assigned FM Melody instruments
		50    - use unmapped FM Melody bank (80 dec)
		51    - use unmapped FM Drum bank (81 dec)
		52-7F - use assigned FM Melody instruments
01/1	Modulation		Modulation On (+Setup)/Off
		00-07 - disable Modulation
		08-7F - enable Modulation
		If no Modulation settings are defined, mid2smps calculates them automatically.
03/3	[unused]		[PSG] Set PSG Noise Mode
		00-7E - enable (Noise Mode = E0 | (Value & 07))
		7F - disable (Noise Mode 00)
		Note: Noise Disable doesn't work with the default Sonic 1 SMPS driver.
06/6	Data Entry MSB		[adjust RPN/NRPN settings*]
07/7	Channel Volume		change channel volume
09/9	[undefined]		Set Note Stop Timeout (notes get stopped after x frames)
0A/10	Pan			[FM/DAC] Set Channel Pan
10/16	General Purpose #1	Modulation Setting 1: initial delay in frames (0 - no delay)
11/17	General Purpose #2	Modulation Setting 2: Update Speed (0 - auto, 1 = fastest, 2 = 50%, 3 = 33%, etc.)
12/18	General Purpose #3	Modulation Setting 3: frequency change per step (0 - auto)
13/19	General Purpose #4	Modulation Setting 4: ramp length (0 - auto, update steps before frequency change is inversed)
20/32	Bank Select LSB		
		[FM] Set instrument range for unmapped banks (Bank Select MSB 50/51)
			00 - use instruments 00..7F
			01 - use instruments 80..FF
		[PSG] Set PSG Tone (only for instrument changes >= 50 [81 Square Wave])
40/64	Damper Pedal (Sustain)	Hold Notes On/Off
		00-0F - normal
		10-7F - disable NoteOff events (NoteOn events still retrigger the notes)
		Note: Useful in combination with Note Fill effects.
41/65	Portatemento Control	No-Attack-Mode Enable/Disable
		Forces no-attack-mode for all notes while enabled.
		00-3F - disable
		40-7F - enable
59/89	[undefined]		set Communication Data (SMPS command E2)
5D/93	Effect 3 Depth (Chorus)	channel volume boost
		00-3F - increase volume (+00..+3F)
		40-7F - reduce volume (-40..-01)
		Volume boost is done in chip volume levels. (see "General Notes")
		Note: Takes effect with next note OR Channel Volume controller.
62/98	NRPN LSB		[adjust RPN/NRPN settings*]
63/99	NRPN MSB		[adjust RPN/NRPN settings*]
64/100	RPN LSB			[adjust RPN/NRPN settings*]
65/101	RPN MSB			[adjust RPN/NRPN settings*]
6F/111	[undefined]		Loop Control
		00 - Loop Start
		01 - Loop End

* mid2smps support a few RPN settings. Settings can be adjusted separately for each channel.
  Adjusting them works as follows:
  1. select the setting by placing (N)RPN MSB and LSB controllers with the setting IDs
  2. adjust the setting via Data Entry MSB (Data Entry LSB is currently not supported)
  
  Currently supported are:
  RPN MSB 00, LSB 00: set Pitch-Bend Range (default is 02 = 2 semitones up and down each)
  RPN MSB 00, LSB 01: set Fine Tuning (default is 40 (hex)/64 (dec). 00 = one semitone down, 7F = one semitone up)
  RPN MSB 00, LSB 02: set Coarse Tuning/Transposition (default is 40 (hex)/64 (dec), in semitones)
  


General notes:
- One frame has a length of 1/60 second.
- Bank Select MSB/LSB controllers only affect the following Instrument Changes and don't have an immediate effect.
- General Purpose #1..#4 only affect the following Modulation controller and don't have an immediate effect.
- The FM chip volume levels are 6/8 db steps (+8 halves the volume)
- The PSG chip volume levels are 6/3 db steps (+3 halves the volume)


Viewing notes:
- Set tab size to 8 for correct view.
- unless mentioned otherwise, all 2-digit numbers are hexadecimal
