There were other drums, and the demo used a song used somewhere in the final game.
The songs had different instruments in Green Hill Zone.
The song was a very fast song and it had special parts that the final didn't have.
Song sounded like masa's demo.
The song intro was very different, like a fanfare, with the title music being very different and having a trumpet.
